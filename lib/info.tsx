      As a fintech and startup enthusiast, I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the financial world. In addition to my work with Zoro Card, I also advise early stage startups on their journey to success.

      To further my skills and knowledge, I'm currently teaching myself how to code. That's actually why I built this website! I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and technology, and I'm excited to continue making an impact in the world of finance and beyond.
